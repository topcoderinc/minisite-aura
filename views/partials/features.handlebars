              <p style="font-size:16px">The Lightning Component framework is a UI framework for developing dynamic web apps for mobile and desktop devices. Itâ€™s a modern framework for building single-page applications engineered for growth. The framework supports partitioned multi-tier component development that bridges the client and server. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side.</p>
              <p style="font-size:16px">The framework includes a set of prebuilt components that you can assemble and configure to form new components in an app. Components support encapsulated and can contain other components, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other Web-enabled code.</p>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Event-driven programming is at the core of Lightning. The idea is that a component registers that it may fire an event and then you write handlers that respond to interface events as they occur. </p>

                    <p>Uses an event-driven architecture for better decoupling between components. Any component can subscribe to an application event, or to a component event they can see.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Faster team development</h3>
                    <p>Building an app with components facilitates parallel design, improving overall development efficiency. Components are encapsulated and their internals stay private, while their public shape is visible to consumers of the component. This strong separation gives component authors freedom to change the internal implementation details and insulates component consumers from those changes.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Performance</h3>
                    <p>Uses a stateful client and stateless server architecture that relies on JavaScript on the client side to manage UI component metadata and application data. The framework uses JSON to exchange data between the server and the client. To maximize efficiency, the server only sends data that is needed by the user.</p>
